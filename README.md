# Flutter Festival Emotions (Fluttemotions)

A Flutter web app for users to show their emotions at a community event.

There are two aspects to this app:

- EmotionsPage: a widget that users load on their phones to post the emotions to the broadcaster
- CameraApp: a widget that whoever is broadcasting using their camera will receive the emotions posted by the users on their end.

This can be ran locally or built as a web app and hosted somewhere (i.e. Firebase Hosting, Github Pages).

Note: Please set up your own Firebase to run this; this is pointing to a basic Firebase project. In the ```lib/firebase_options.dart``` replace the config information available in your Firebase project.

Enjoy!!!!
